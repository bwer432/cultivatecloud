# cultivatecloud
Demonstration scripts for provisioning, exploring, and practicing AWS resources. Documentation in a parallel repo at https://github.com/bwer432/cultivatecloudsite (with the 'site' on the end). NOTE: You are responsible for all resources you allocate in your AWS accounts. NOTE: I work for AWS, but my opinions are my own.
